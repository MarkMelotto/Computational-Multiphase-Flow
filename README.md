# Project 1
*Steady fully-developed single-phase channel flow (same for all groups)*
 - Develop a routine to compute the velocity in a steady fully-developed single-phase
channel flow with variable viscosity, using the finite-volume method. 
- Assume that the viscosity profile is a prescribed input to the routine. 

Consider three possible wall boundary
conditions: 
1. prescribed velocity at the wall,
2. prescribed velocity-gradient at the wall,
3. prescribed relation between the shear-stress at the wall and the velocity field.

Consider two possible global boundary conditions: 
1. prescribed pressure-gradient
2. prescribed flow-rate.
